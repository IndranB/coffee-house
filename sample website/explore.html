    <h1>ESPRESSO COFFEE</h1><p>Espresso is a concentrated coffee beverage brewed by forcing hot water through finely-ground coffee under high pressure. It's a small but potent shot of coffee,typically around 1 ounce (30 milliliters). The process results in a strong and rich flavor with a layer of crema, a creamy, golden-brown foam on top.<br>Espresso serves as the base for various coffee drinks like lattes.</p>
